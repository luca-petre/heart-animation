## Features
- Glowing animated heart shape  
- Flowing particle effect forming the heart  
- Pulsing beat animation for extra life  
- Runs directly in any modern browser  

---

## How It Works
The animation is drawn on an HTML5 `<canvas>` using JavaScript.  
A dynamic particle system moves smoothly toward points that outline a heart shape, creating a glowing, flowing visual. CSS adds a pulsing effect to enhance the feeling of a beating heart.  

---

## Customization
You can easily tweak the animation by editing `heart.js` and `heart.css`:
- Change colors (HLS values) for a different vibe
- Adjust particle size or spread
- Modify the pulsing effect timing
